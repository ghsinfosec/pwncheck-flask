    <h1>What is pwncheck?</h1>
    <p>pwncheck is a project that leverages the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">Have I Been Pwned</a>
    Pwned Passwords API to check your password against a list of over 613 million leaked passwords from
    known data breaches. You simply enter your password, or a password you'd like to use, and see
    if it's been listed in a data breach.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Passwords are NOT stored in this list, but rather stored as a
    partial SHA1 hash of the original leaked password. This method ensures that the leaked passwords
    cannot be seen in plain text or by reversing the hashing algorithm, making it a secure way to check
    for known leaked passwords.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>Once again, be aware that your password is NOT stored in any way by the API or by this server.
    Privacy is highly important and therefore this utility was developed in such a way as to
    ensure complete privacy on the part of the user(s).</p>
    <p>The way pwncheck works is to generate a SHA1 hash of the password you enter. This hash
    is then split into 2 parts; a prefix and a suffix. The prefix is used to look up the hash
    stored in the Pwned Passwords API. The API only contains the suffix of the hash that gets
    generated on password submission, and not the full password hash. Also contained with the hash
    suffix is a count of the times that the submitted password has been seen in data breached. To test
    it out, try entering the word 'password' in the search bar and see how many times it was discovered.</p>
